# Demo_Java_JUnit

This project is sandbox for demonstrating Java and JUnit. The Java application is a simplified engine for a hypothetical on-line bookstore. This application leverages the database created for a C# Web API project with similar functionality (refer to https://github.com/MOwed06/Demo_CSharp_API).

This project is a first step toward an eventual Java Web API application.
